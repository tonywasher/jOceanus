jOceanus Project

  jOceanus is an overarching project that was derived from the embedded jMoneyWise project.

  In developing <<jMoneyWise>>, a number of supporting generic components were built. Together with jMoneyWise, these have
been aggregated as the <<jOceanus>> project.

  The project is still under development.
