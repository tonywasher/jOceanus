Tethys Project

  Tethys is a subComponent of the jOceanus project. It provides GUI utilities for the jOceanus project.
It is named after the titaness Tethys who was the embodiment of the waters of the world.

  Each Gui element is abstracted and provided by a factor of which there are javaFX and Swing variants. Events are
provided via the <<OceanusEvent>> interface and all differences between javaFX and Swing implementations are hidden.

  This allows applications to be written without references to either Swing or javaFX implementation details.
