JDateDay Project

  JDateDay is an extension of the JDateButton project. It modifies JDateButton so that a DateDay object is returned instead of a Calendar object. This DateDay objet has no concept of time of day, merely the date. All functionality of JDateButton is provided. 
  
  In addition to the facilities provided by JDateButton, JDateDay provides a DateDayRange class which handles a contiguous range of Dates with a start and and end. A small JPanel selector object is provided to enable selection of such ranges.
