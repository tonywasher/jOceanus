jSvnManager Project

  jSvnManager is a subComponent of the jOceanus project.

  jSvnManager is a Manager application for SubVersion development. It provides some of the same functionality as
TortoiseSvn, but is tailored specifically to simplify development tasks such as tagging and branching. It also directly
links to the Issue Management system Jira via the <<jJira>> component.

  This is currently under construction.
