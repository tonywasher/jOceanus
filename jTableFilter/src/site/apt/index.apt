jTableFilter Project

  jTableFilter is a subComponent of the jOceanus project.

  It provides an extension of the TableRowSorter class that utilises the natural ordering of rows rather
than requiring the user to specify a sort order. It also provides simple filtering.

  A simple demo program is included to illustrate both the capabilities and usage. It can be seen on the 
{{{./demo/demo.html}Demo page}} of this webSite.
