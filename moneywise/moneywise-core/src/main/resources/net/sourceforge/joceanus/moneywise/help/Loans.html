<h1>Loans</h1>
<p><b>Loans</b> are accounts where monies are lent to or by you, such as CreditCards and Mortgages,
and are viewed as monetary assets. Each <b>loan</b> has a <b>parent</b> institution or individual, so for example a Barclays loan would have Barclays as a parent. 
<p>The value of a <b>Loan</b> at any particular time is the sum of credits to the account minus the sum of debits from the account, up to that time.
<p>A <b>loan</b> may generate (or charge) interest, which can be credited to/debited from itself or transferred to/from another account. 
<p>For reporting purposes, the interest is deemed to be income from (or expense to) the <b>parent</b> of the loan.
