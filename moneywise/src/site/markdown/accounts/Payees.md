# Payees
**Payees** are individuals or institutions such as Banks or Shops. They are not viewed as monetary assets,
but rather as source of income or targets of expense. 

Most monetary accounts (other than **Cash**) have a **Payee** as a parent, and the parent is viewed as the source of income/expense related
to that account.
