	<h1>AccountType</h1>
	<p>The <b>AccountType</b> controls the set of transactions that can occur involving an account of that type</p>
	<p>AccountTypes are initially divided into four classes</p>
	<dl>
	<dt>External</dt>
	<dd>These accounts do not count towards assets. Each non-external (internal) asset has a <b>parent</b> account external for reporting purposes.
	For instance, interest payments generated by a savings account are treated as being paid by the provider (parent) of the savings account.   
	<dt>Monetary</dt>
	<dd>Current/Savings Accounts are viewed as Monetary Assets, and are included in asset reporting. A monetary account generally has an associated rate 
	(e.g. 2.5% APR), and these rates may vary over the lifetime of the account. A set of rates can be associated with an account so that the rate applicable
	to the account at any particular time can be determined. The value of a Monetary asset at any time is the sum of
	credits to the account minus the sum of debits from the account. Interest payment debits relating to an account are viewed as debits from the parent.</dd>
	<dt>Debt</dt>
	<dd>CreditCards and Mortgages are viewed as Monetary Assets, albeit normally of negative value, and are included in asset reporting. The value of a Debt asset
	at any time is calculated the same as Monetary assets, but generally no rates are applicable to Debts.</dd>
	<dt>Priced</dt>
	<dd>Share Accounts and similar are viewed as Priced Assets, and are included in asset reporting. A Priced asset has the concept of units (e.g. 10 shares) and units
	can be credited/debited to/from the account similar to money for a monetary account. The number of units for a priced asset at any particular time is simply 
	the sum of units credited minus the sum of units debited. A priced account has a set of prices associated with it, with each price relating to the unit price at a
	particular date. The value of a Priced asset at any time is the net units multiplied by the most recent price for the account.</dd>
