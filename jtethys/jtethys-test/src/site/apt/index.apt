Tethys Project

  Tethys is a subComponent of the jOceanus project. It provides various utilities for the jOceanus project.
It is named after the titaness Tethys who was the embodiment of the waters of the world.

  The following utilities are provided

* A generic <<OceanusException>> exception class

  This class extends a standard exception by allowing an object to be associated with the exception. This is particularly
useful for data applications since the data that caused the exception can be associated with it.

* A <<DataConverter>> class

  This provides methods to convert between byteArrays and charArrays/longs/integers/strings and also methods to 
format/parse a byteArray to/from hexStrings and Base64Strings.

* A generic EventManager.

    This provides a <<EventManager>> class which supports <<ActionEvents>> and <<ChangeEvents>> on a generic object.
It is particularly useful for JPanels and JTables which only have the base capability of firing PropertyChangeEvents.
Three classes <<JEventObject>>, <<JEventPanel>> and <<JEventTable>> are provided as extensions of Object, 
JPanel and JTables respectively, with added ChangeEvent and ActionEvent support.

    In addition a set of wrapper classes are provided to extend <<JTabbedPane>>, <<JPanel>> and <<JScrollPane>> such that
it will pass the setEnabled() method on to all subcomponents.
	
* A set of Swing Utilities

    * Utilities to help with SpringLayout (based on the Oracle SpringUtilities example), and GridBagLayout

    * A set of classes to enable Scrollable Menus

    * A set of JButton extensions to utilise Scrollable menus and icons

    * A class to provide simple sorting/filtering in a JTable

* A DateDay class

  This is an extension of the JDateButton project. It modifies JDateButton so that a JDateDay object is returned
instead of a Calendar object. This JDateDay object has no concept of time of day, merely the date. All functionality
of JDateButton is provided. 
  
  In addition to the facilities provided by JDateButton, JDateDay provides a JDateDayRange class which handles
a contiguous range of Dates with a start and an end. A small JPanel selector object is provided to enable selection
of such ranges.
  
* A set of decimal classes

  TethysDecimal is a package that provides a Decimal implementation in many ways similar to that provided by BigDecimal,
except that the class is mutable, allowing for much faster arithmetic.

  Rather than deal with arbitrarily large numbers, TethysDecimal stores the value as a simple long, and so is not suitable for
extremely large values, since precision will be lost. Users should continue to use BigDecimal for these situations.

  This implementation is particularly suited to financial applications since a monetary value of
$10,000,000,000,000,000.00 can easily be accommodated within a long. As long as you are not dealing with the
US National Debt, this will be sufficient for most purposes.

* A simple Help Manager

    This is still under development.
