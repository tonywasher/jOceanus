jThemis Project

  jThemis is a subComponent of the jOceanus project, which looks after project management
such as source code and issue management. It is named after the titaness Themis, who was viewed 
as the embodiment of divine order, law, and custom.

  It currently provides access to Jira functionality (using the Jira SOAP API) and Subversion (using the SvnKit API).
It is intended to be extended to provide access to Git via the JGit API.
