        <section name="Overview">
            <p>ZipFiles are supported via the <strong>GordianZipFactory</strong> interface.</p>
            <p>GordianKnot provides support for to creating and reading encrypted ZipFiles.
                This is built on top of the Java ZipFile support and utilises the encryption facilities of GordianKnot to encrypt and
                decrypt each file entry. LZMA compression is also provided (based on the 7-Zip LZMA SDK), which provides significantly
                improved compression over the Deflation standard Java method.</p>
            <p>Encryption is performed in a similar fashion to KeySet encryption, as follows (N = number of configured encryption steps),
                although all keys and initialisationVectors are randomly generated per zipEntry. The selection of encryption algorithms is
                also randomly done rather than from a seed value</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Digest is calculated on the plain text</li>
                <li>LZMA compression is performed</li>
                <li>StreamKey encryption is performed</li>
                <li>(N-1)*SymKey ECB encryption (first with ISO7816-4 padding, remainder with NONE)</li>
                <li>SymKey SIC encryption</li>
                <li>Mac calculated on encrypted data</li>
            </ol>
            <p>All filenames in the public zipFile directory are written as File1, File2 etc to further hide information</p>.
            <p>The names of the files, and the (wrapped) encryption details are written as an encrypted final zipEntry</p>
            <p>The keySetHash used to encrypt the final file entry is recorded as additionalData for the directory entry</p>
            <p>Note that updating of ZipFiles is not supported, only creation and extraction.</p>

        <section name="ZipLocks">
            <p>Each zip file is secured using a zipLock structure, which at its core is a lock. Any of the three supported lock types can be used</p>
