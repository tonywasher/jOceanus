JDateButton Project

  JDateButton is a Java Swing button that provides the ability to select a date using a popup menu.
The button can also be used within a JTable as a CellEditor. 
  
  Controls are provided to limit the range of dates that may be selected and to allow the user
to explicitly select no date if required. The locale and date format can also be easily controlled.

  Note that this only allows dates to be selected and not times. The Calendar object that is returned
is set to be noon on the selected date.
