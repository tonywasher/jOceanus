jJira Project

  jJira is a subComponent of the jOceanus project.

  jJira is a wrapper function on top of the SOAP Jira access to make it easy for a source control system such as 
SubVersion to interface with Jira, without having to deal with the interface method. It is intended for use by the 
<<jSvnManager>> component, but is currently work in progress.
