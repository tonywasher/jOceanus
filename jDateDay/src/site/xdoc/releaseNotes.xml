    <section name="Overview">
      <p>This project was the original version of JDateButton. When I decided to upload the project to sourceforge, I
felt that it would be more useful to split the JDateButton functionality out, based on the standard Java Calendar object.</p>
       <p>This project utilises a data object called DateDay, which is simply a Calendar object with the time information split out, so that it represents a whole day, rather than an instant of time within that day</p>
       <p>In addition to this object, a DateDayRange object is defined to represent a contiguous range of dates. Various helper classes are provided to support these two objects</p>
