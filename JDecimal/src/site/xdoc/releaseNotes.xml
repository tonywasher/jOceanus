    <section name="Overview">
      <p>This project was built in order to provide a better handling of decimals that is provided in the standard Java library, in particular to support handling of monetary values in a financial application.</p>
      <p>Java provides support for Decimals in two ways.</p>
        <dl>
	  <dt>Double/Float</dt>
	  <dd>Decimals can be represented as float/double. However adding two floats together is a notoriously unreliable method and provides some shocking results for the unwary <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1661273/floating-point-arithmetic-not-producing-exact-results-in-java">(see article)</a></dd>
	  <dt>BigDecimal</dt>
	  <dd>This provides accurate and predictable results, but is slow due to the fact that BigDecimal is immutable</dd>
	</dl>
       <p>The aim of this project is to provide a cut down BigDecimal object that is not immutable and hence is more appropriate for usage in financial applications</p>
