<h1>Deposits</h1>
<p><b>Deposits</b> are accounts where monies are held on your behalf, such as Bank(Checking) and Savings Accounts,
and are viewed as monetary assets. Each <b>deposit</b> has a <b>parent</b> institution, so for example a Barclays bank account would have Barclays as a parent. 
<p>The value of a <b>Deposit</b> at any particular time is the sum of credits to the account minus the sum of debits from the account, up to that time.
<p>A <b>deposit</b> may generate interest payments, which can be credited to itself or transferred to another deposit account. 
It will generally has an associated interest rate (e.g. 2.5% APR), and this rate may vary over the lifetime of the deposit.
A set of rates can be associated with a deposit so that the rate applicable to the account at any particular time can be determined.
<p>For reporting purposes, the interest is deemed to be income from the <b>parent</b> of the deposit.
