Astraeus Project

  Astraeus is a subComponent of the jOceanus project, providing build post-processing support.
It is named after the titan Astraeus who was the god of dusk.

  At present it's only purpose is to run a post-Build script as a TestCase to create Windows batch files/Unix shell
scripts as required to correctly run each application (i.e. correct module-path and splash screen). In future any
jlink/jpackage modules will also be created here.
